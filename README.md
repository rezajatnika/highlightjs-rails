# highlightjs-rails

A gemified version of the awesome [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'highlightjs-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install highlightjs-rails

## Usage

The highlight.js files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. Add these lines to application.js:

```js
//= require highlight
//= require languages/ruby
```

and to application.css:

```css
*= require styles/github
```

The bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the library along with one of the styles and calling `initHighlightingOnLoad`:

```js
hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();
```
